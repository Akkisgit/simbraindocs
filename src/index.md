# Note: This Document is a Work in Progress
Currently it is in a highly fragmentary state. We are hoping to have a first draft around the time Simbrain 4.0 beta is actually released, which should be late summer 2024. 

# Documentation for Simbrain 4.0
Simbrain is a tool for building artificial neural networks that has been developed with the philosophy of ease-of-use and intuitive design. We encourage you to simply launch Simbrain and experiment. For in-depth documentation on each aspect of Simbrain follow the links below. Simbrain is open source and uses the GNU license. For credits click [here](https://simbrain.net/SimbrainCredits.html).

# Workspace
The Simbrain workspace is the encompassing framework which contains all simulation components (networks, worlds, etc.), as well as mechanisms for connecting them together via "couplings", scripting, etc. Other general topics concerning simbrain simulations.

# Network
The network component of Simbrain represents a simulated neural circuit. Networks are the core component of a Simbrain simulation. They are built using a simple graphical interface.

# Worlds
Worlds are components that interact with Network components by giving and/or receiving information. For example OdorWorld simulates a creature's ability to move and smell in a simple two-dimensional world.

# Plots
Visualize network activity and other data with Bar charts, Pie Charts, Projections, Time Series, and other charts.

# Simulation
Environment for building custom simulations. Can be used to create custom simulations, beyond what the built-in GUI tools provide.



# Evolution
Framework for evolving neural netwoks.

# Terminal
Running from terminal.

# Doc Viewer
Compoent for embedding documents in a workspace.

# Utilities/Others
Some utilities that are used throughout Simbrain.
