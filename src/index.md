# Note: This Document is a Work in Progress
Currently these documents are in a highly fragmentary state. We are hoping to have a first draft around the time Simbrain 4.0 beta is actually released, which should be late summer 2024. 

# Documentation for Simbrain 4.0
Simbrain is a tool for building artificial neural networks that has been developed with the philosophy of ease-of-use and intuitive design. We encourage you to simply launch Simbrain and experiment. For in-depth documentation on each aspect of Simbrain follow the links below. Simbrain is open source and uses the GNU license. For credits click [here](https://simbrain.net/SimbrainCredits.html).

# Workspace
The Simbrain [workspace](docs/workspace/workspace.html) is the encompassing framework which contains all simulation components (networks, worlds, etc.), as well as mechanisms for connecting them together via "couplings", scripting, etc. Other general topics concerning simbrain simulations.

# Network
The [network](docs/network/network.html) components of Simbrain represents a simulated neural circuit. Networks are the core component of a Simbrain simulation. They are built using a simple graphical interface.

# Worlds
In Simbrain, [worlds](docs/worlds/worlds.html) are components that interact with Network components by giving and/or receiving information. For example OdorWorld simulates a creature's ability to move and smell in a simple two-dimensional world.

# Plots
Use Simbrain [plots](docs/plots/plots.html) to visualize network activity and other data with Bar charts, Pie Charts, Projections, Time Series, and other charts.

# Simulations
Simbrain includes an environment for building custom [simulations](docs/simulations/simulations.html) in kotlin or java. Can be used to create custom simulations, beyond what the built-in GUI tools provide.

# Evolution
Simbrain includes a framework for [evolving neural netwoks](docs/evolution/evolution.html).

# Utilities
Simbrain [utilities](docs/utilities/utilities.html) include the [Simbrain console](docs/utilities/terminal.html) and [doc viewer](docs/utilities/docviewer.html).
