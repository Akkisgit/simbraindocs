Simbrain is a tool for building artificial neural networks that has been developed with the philosophy of ease-of-use
and intuitive design. We encourage you to simply launch Simbrain and experiment. For in-depth documentation on each
aspect of Simbrain follow the links below. Simbrain is open source and uses the GNU license. For credits click here.
Note that if you are reading this documentation directly from the Simbrain help menu, that you are reading a local copy
that comes packaged with Simbrain; the online copy may have newer information.
