## Methods

There are three main ways to connect neurons to other neurons (or to themselves) with synapses.

* Quick-Connect (1-2 keyboard method)
    * To perform the 1-2 method: Select your desired source neuron(s), designate them as source by pressing ‘1.’ Select your desired target neuron(s) then designate them as target by pressing ‘2.’ 
* Menu Commands
    * To use menu commands: Select your desired source neuron(s), designate them as source by right-clicking on one of the selected neurons (if more than one is selected) and connect (all-to-all) by right-clicking on one of the selected neurons and clicking ‘Connect Neurons.’ This will open up a window that gives you the option of customizing your connection preferences.
* Network Groups
    * To connect a whole neuron group to itself or to another group, you can use either the 1-2 keyboard method or menu commands. But instead of selecting individual neurons, you will select the group header on the upper left of the network. When connecting a group to itself, a second group header should appear, this doesn’t create a new group, but rather a subgroup representing all the connections made. By selecting the second group, you are able to make edits and update your connection preferences. Synapses are invisible by default, to make visible,  right-click on the second group and check the toggle synapse visibility button.
