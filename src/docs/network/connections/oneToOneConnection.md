# One To One Connection

One-to-one connects a set of source neurons to a set of target neurons in a manner that respects their spatial arrangement (results should not generally cross).

- Orientation: Whether to prefer horizontal or vertical orientation when making the links.

- Bidirectional Connections: If checked, bi-directional one-to-one connections are created.
