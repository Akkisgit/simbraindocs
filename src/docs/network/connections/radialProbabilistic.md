# Radial Probabilistic

For each source neuron consider every target neuron in a radius and make excitatory and inhibitory synapses with them according to specified probabilities.

**Excitatory Probability**. Probability of making excitatory connections to neighboring neurons with the excitatory radius.

**Inhibitory Probability**.Probability of making inhibitory connections to neighboring neurons within the inhibitory radius.

**Excitatory Radius**. Radius within which to make excitatory connections.

**Inhibitory Radius**. Radius within which to make inhibitory connections.

**Allow self connections**. Allow synapses from neurons to themselves.
