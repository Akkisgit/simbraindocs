# Connection Strategies

Connection strategies are one way of [connecting neurons](../buildBasics#Connection_Methods) They rules used to create rule-based patterns of connections between source and target groups of neurons. The connection strategies generally also set an [excitatory / inhibitory ratio](../otherDialogs#Excitatory-Inhibitory-Ratio). All weights strenghts are simply 1 or -1 by default. To set a distribution on weights strengths the [synapse adjustment panel](../otherDialogs#Synapse-Adjustment-Dialog) should be used.

Connection strategies can be invoked in these ways:

- There is a default strategy that is set in network preferences when using the 1-2 trick. 
- You can also right click and select one from the `connect neurons` submenu.
- Synapse groups are also associated with connection strategies that can be applied
