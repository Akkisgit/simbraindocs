# Probabilistic

Emit a value of *response value* with probability *activation probability* whenever a pre-synaptic spike occurs.

**Response Value**

Amount by which the synapse's strength will be scaled to determine the post-synaptic response of the synapse in the event that this responder is actually active.

**Activation Probability**

Probability of producing an output; must be between 0 and 1.
