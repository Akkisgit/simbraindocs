# Rise and Decay

The response rises up to a maximum value, *maximum response*, and then decays back to a base-line value, 0, at a rate which is proportional to the *decay constant*. The global *time step* can be set when this function is selected.

**Maximum Response**

Maximum response value.

**Time Constant**

The time constant of decay and recovery (ms).
