# Step

Before the spike, the step function persists at base-line value, 0. After the spike, the waveform's *response height* increases by a constant amount for a specific number of iterations or time-steps called the *response time*. After the *response time* has passed, the function returns to its base-line value.

**Response Height**

The value by which the strength of the synapse is scaled to determine the post-synaptic response.

**Response Time**

The amount of time the post-synaptic response impinges on the post-synaptic cell.
