# Spiking Threshold

A simple **spiking neuron** that spikes when input to the neuron is above the specified threshold. When using a loose spiking threshold neuron, it helps to have an external clamped linear neuron to feed activation into the neuron.

### Threshold

Input value above which the neuron spikes.
