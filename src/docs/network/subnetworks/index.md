# Subnetworks

Subnetworks are a special kind of network model that can encompass multiple [neuron groups](../neurongroups), [synapse groups](../synapsegroups.html), neuron collections and custom update rules.

For more information on specific types of subnetwork click on the items in the menu on the right.

**Note**: The input nodes of many subnetworks are, by default, **clamped**. This is to make it easier to manually set and test their values. However, if you want to connect other neurons to the input nodes of a subnetwork you should unclamp the input neurons.
