# Document Viewer

A simple component for including documentation, descriptions, and instructions to be saved as part of a simulation, usually as part of a workspace file. Most of the default workspaces in the workspace folder have document viewers

To add a Document Viewer to a workspace use `Insert > New Doc Viewer`.

The Document Viewer contains two tabs, one for viewing the file, and one for editing it, in markdown. 

All changes in the edit tab take effect as soon as you click on the display tab. 

Editing is straightforward using standard [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Simple html is supported in markdown. The default document viewer includes sample markdown and also shows how to embed images.
