# Tables

Simbrain tables are tables used throughout Simbrain to display data and allow for some numerical operations (e.g. an ability to randomize or normalize data).

<!-- TODO --> Add image

Examples of Simbrain components that use tables include **Data World** and the **Test Inputs** component.

Table data can be imported from and exported to **comma separated values** or *.csv files (which can be read by most spreadsheet programs, e.g. Excel).

Most table operations (e.g. randomization) are applied by selecting cells and either using a hotkey or applying an item from a toolbar, menu, or context menu. Note: In some cases the hotkey and context menu give inconisistent results. In those cases try using toolbars or regular menus.
