## Edit

- Set rows / columns: Add a set number of row(s) and column(s).

### Fill Values

- Fill Table: Fill the entire table with a set value.

- ZeroFill the Table: Fill the entire table with the zero value.

### Randomize

- Randomize: Randomizes selected cell(s) in the table by sampling from an uniform distribution.

- Randomization Bounds: Adjusts the upper and lower limit for randomization of the data in the table.

- Normalize Column(s): **Rescales** the values in a column using maximum and minimum values so that they all lie in the range [0,1].

- Shuffle Rows: Randomly permute the rows of the table.

- Iteration Mode: When a table is in iteration mode, every time a network it is coupled to is iterated, the selected row moves forward. Running a coupled network thereby has the effect of iterating through the entire set of columns. This feature allows one to create a specific sequence of inputs to a network and repeatedly deliver it.
