# Property Editors

Simbrain includes a sophisticated system for automating the tedious process of creating dialog to edit propeties of objects. Similar to the old javabeans framework but producing nicer dialogs and allowing more customizations. Sometimes the result ends up janky, but it allows us to rapidly add to the software.  

Quite a few features are possible, like ways to determine the increment up and down, triangles to reveal and hide information, tooltips, etc.
