# Pie Chart

Pie chart is a standard pie chart that can be used to represent the relative sizes of a set of quantities in a Simbrain simulation. For example this can be useful for representing how evenly distributed a set of neural activations is. When one neuron dominates, it will take up a larger slice. When all neurons are equally active, all slices will be of equal size.
